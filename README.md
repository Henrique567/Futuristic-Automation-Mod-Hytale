# Futuristic Automation Mod – Hytale

This project is a mod for **Hytale** focused on **futuristic machines and resource automation**.

## Overview
The goal of this mod is to expand and improve the game's crafting stations and furnaces, introducing automated systems for processing resources and manufacturing items while maintaining balance with Hytale’s core gameplay.

The mod is inspired by projects such as **Mekanism**, particularly in terms of machine-based progression, but **does not include reactors or highly complex energy systems**. Instead, the focus is on clean automation, efficiency and smooth progression.

## Features (Planned)
- Futuristic processing machines  
- Improved crafting and smelting automation  
- Progressive technological tiers  
- Simple and intuitive energy system  

## Visual Style
The machines will follow a futuristic aesthetic. The final visual direction is flexible and may evolve during development.

## Contributions
This is a collaborative project. Contributions are welcome from:
- Programmers
- 3D Modelers
- Game Designers
